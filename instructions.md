Upload your table in a csv format.

You will need to clean and arrange your data from the microprobe.

Your data number points for the microprobe are usually in the form: 2/1. R will not recognize this form and you will need to re-number them to a whole integer.

You must use the Nb of ions from the microprobe data. This code assumes you have used the correct analysis tool and will treat values as correct.
